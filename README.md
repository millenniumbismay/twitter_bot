A simple twitter bot which responds with a "Thank you" on getting a tweet of "Congratulations".

Uses Python 3.6

and tweepy 3.6
install tweepy as :

or can install in a virtual environment(recommended)
source activate my_env36 #my_env36 is an environment created in conda with python 3.6
pip install tweepy
sudo apt update

check by: 
import tweepy in python console

Go to tweepy documentations and then find the adjacent attributes as used.

This is a simple bot. I will be working on it for some time to upgrade it.

Thank you.
